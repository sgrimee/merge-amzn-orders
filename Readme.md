# Amazon Order History Reporter merging tool

Simple script to merge csv reports generated by the [Amazon Order History Reporter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-order-history-repo/mgkilgclilajckgnedgjgnfdokkgnibi) Chrome extension. This takes care of merging all reports in a folder provided they follow the naming convention CC-*.csv where CC is the country code of the amazon instance it was downloaded from. US, FR, DE and UK are supported but others can be added trivially. Correction is made for the locale (comma versus dot decimal separator). The currency is split into a separate column and a new column with the country is added for better reporting.
The path to the folder where the source csv files reside needs to be given as argument (can be '.'). The output is written boringly to output.csv.
